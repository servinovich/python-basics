\# 🐍 Python Basics Portfolio



This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python scripts that demonstrate core programming concepts such as user input, conditionals, exception handling, and object-oriented programming. Each file is self-contained and interactive.



\## Files and Descriptions



\### script\_1\_greeting.py



Prompts the user to enter their name and prints a friendly greeting.

📎 Concepts: input(), f-strings, console output

🧪 Example:



```

Enter your name: Alex

Hello, Alex! Welcome to my portfolio with Python basics.

```



\### script\_2\_even\_check.py



Checks whether the input number is even or odd, with error handling for invalid inputs.

📎 Concepts: try/except, modulus operator, input conversion

🧪 Example:



```
Enter a number: 13

The number is odd.
```



\### script\_4\_save\_div.py



Safely divides two user-provided numbers and handles zero-division and type errors.

📎 Concepts: try/except/finally, function definition, input handling

🧪 Example:



```
Enter a numerator: 10

Enter a denominator: 0

Error: Cannot divide by zero.

Processing Complete.
```



\### script\_5\_class.py



Defines a Vehicle class and creates two instances with different properties. Demonstrates class structure, constructors, and methods.

📎 Concepts: OOP, class attributes and methods, object creation

🧪 Example Output:



```
Properties of Vehicle: 

Model: Honda

Color: white

Max speed: 250

Miles: 20

Capacity: 4
```
